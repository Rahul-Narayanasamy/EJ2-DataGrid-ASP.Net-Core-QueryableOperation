**Syncfusion EJ2 Grid QueryableOperation**

This example shows how to perform grid paging, filtering, sorting, etc. operations at server side using **QueryableOperation**.

DataOperations can fetch the whole data from database and perform the operations(paging, sorting, filtering, etc) at server. But in QueryableOperation, it fetch the data as Queryable format. If we use DataOperations in large amount of data set(like 1,00,000 records in database), each and every action the whole data is fetched from database and perform the corresponding action at server side. 

In QueryableOperation, it pass the query to database and performs the corresponding action at database. It will return the result as queryable format.
